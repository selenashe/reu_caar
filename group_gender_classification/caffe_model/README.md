This folder contains work that uses YOLOv8 as a Face/Object Detector and the Caffe Model by [Levi Hassner](https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2015_CVPR) as our Gender Classifier. 

We find that the detection model (YOLOv8) does not reasonably well, but the gender classifier has low accuracy (right around 50% on a small dataset) and does not perform reliably.
